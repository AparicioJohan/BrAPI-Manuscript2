## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The Breeding API (BrAPI) project is an effort to enable interoperability among plant breeding databases.
BrAPI is a standardized RESTful web service API specification for communicating plant breeding data.
This community driven standard is free to be used by anyone interested in plant breeding data management.
This manuscript describes updates and outlook for the current version of BrAPI.
