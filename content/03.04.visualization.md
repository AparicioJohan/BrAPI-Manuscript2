#### Flapjack

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
[Flapjack](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq580] is a multi-platform desktop application for data visualization and breeding analysis (eg, pedigree verification, marker-assisted backcrossing and forward breeding) using high-throughput genotype data. Data can be easily imported into Flapjack from any BrAPI compatible data source with genotype data available. [Flapjack Bytes](https://github.com/cropgeeks/flapjack-bytes) is a smaller, lightweight and fully web-based counterpart to Flapjack, which can be easily embedded into a database website to provide similar visualizations online. Traditionally supporting its own text-based data formats, Flapjack's use of BrAPI has streamlined the end-user experience for data import and work is underway to determine the best methods to exchange analysis results using future versions of the API.

#### Helium

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
Helium is a platform for reviewing and managing pedigree data. It is BrAPI enabled, so pedigree data can be viewed straight from a database. 

#### Tassel

I don't know much about Tassel or its BrAPI compliance. This is filler text for the layout of the manuscript.

#### Trait Selector BrAPP

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
BrAPPs are simple tools developed by the BrAPI community that are entirely reliant on BrAPI for their data requirements. This means a single BrAPI can be shared and used by many organizations, as long as those organizations have the standard BrAPI endpoints available. For example, the Trait Selector BrAPP is used to search and select useful traits, using a visual aid to help the user find exactly what they need. The BrAPP relies only on the BrAPI Trait endpoints to function, so any data resources with a the Trait endpoints available can add this tool to their system.

#### DArTView

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
DArTView is a desktop application for visualizing genotype variant data and looking for trends or correlations. It is newly BrAPI compatible and can use BrAPI as an input data source.

#### DivBrowse

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
DivBrowse is a BrAPI compatible tool for visualizing genotype variant data.
