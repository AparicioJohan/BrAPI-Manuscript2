#### Flapjack

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
Flapjack is a desktop application for visualizing and analyzing genotype data. Data can be easily imported into Flapjack from any BrAPI compatible data source with genotype data available. Flapjack Bytes is the smaller, web based counterpart to Flapjack, which can be imbedded into a database website and provide the visualizations online. 

#### Helium

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
Helium is a platform for reviewing and managing pedigree data. It is BrAPI enabled, so pedigree data can be viewed straight from a database. 

#### Tassel

I don't know much about Tassel or its BrAPI compliance. This is filler text for the layout of the manuscript.

#### Trait Selector BrAPP

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
BrAPPs are simple tools developed by the BrAPI community that are entirely reliant on BrAPI for their data requirements. This means a single BrAPI can be shared and used by many organizations, as long as those organizations have the standard BrAPI endpoints available. For example, the Trait Selector BrAPP is used to search and select useful traits, using a visual aid to help the user find exactly what they need. The BrAPP relies only on the BrAPI Trait endpoints to function, so any data resources with a the Trait endpoints available can add this tool to their system.
