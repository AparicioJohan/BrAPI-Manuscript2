#### BraPI endpoints for AGENT Portal
{#sec:AGENT_BrAPI_Backend}
For the joint research data infrastructure for the federation of collections of genotypic and phenotypic data from European gene banks and bioinformatics institutes, a AGENT portal ({@fig:AGENT_WebFrontend}) as database infrastructure for integrated plant genetic resources on ex-situ genebanks is being created. It provides, manual data exploration, machine-readable access via BrAPI and provide data to the cored data deposition resources at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).

The AGENT database backend aggregates curated and integrated passport data, phenotypic and genotypic data about wheat and barley accessions of 18 project partners are harmonized and integrated via BrAPI endpoints (https://github.com/AGENTproject/BrAPI) and explorable in a web portal (https://agent.ipk-gatersleben.de). The BrAPI endpoints were made available by scattered implementation. Genotyping data use DivBrowse [6] storage engine and BrAPI interface. Endpoints for sample data are implemented using AGENT database SQL to BrAPI broker service.
To integrate those BrAPI endpoint provider into a single service and URL scheme, we work on their integration in a BrAPI proxy service. As next steps, we will expand BrAPI implementation to enable the integration of analysis pipelines in the AGENT portal, e.g. for genebank mining tools such as the FIGS+ pipeline developed by AGENT partner ICARDA [7]. Another perspective is to integrate the data collected in the AGENT project into the European Search Catalogue for Plant Genetic Resources (EURISCO) [8] and to implement BrAPI endpoints to make data on PGR collections in European genebanks programmatically accessible.

#### MIAPPE "BrAPI to ISA" service

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
MIAPPE and BrAPI are designed to be inter-compatible. ISA-TAB is a file based implementation of MIAPPE. The "BrAPI to ISA" service is a converter between the ISA-TAB files and the BrAPI RESTful endpoints.
