### Federated Data Management Infrastructures
<!-- 
(AGENT, INCREASING, EURISCO, DataPLANT, NFDI4BioDiversity, FAIRAgro)

* General use case description(s) -  AgrosystemIntegration of germplasm collections in context of data trustee models among private economy and public research, integration of ex-situ genebanks (EU H2020 projects AGENT, INCREASING), integrated agrosystems and plant research infrastructure
* Specific tool examples - BraPI endpoints for AGENT, IPK-Genebank, MIAPPE ISA-TAB2BRAPI service
* Alternate solutions/ why is it better with BrAPI - Schema.ORG lightweight meta data harvesting, ARCs as collaborative data decoration, API and publication pipeline
* future related use cases, areas to improve - LIMS to BrAPI proxies -->
