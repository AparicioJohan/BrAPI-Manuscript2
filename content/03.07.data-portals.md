#### FAIDARE

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph. Cyril P, first draft-->
FAIDARE (https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/) is a data discovery portal providing a biologist friendly search system over a global federation of 33 plant research databases. It allows to identify data resources using a full text approach completed with domain specific filters and to link back to the original database for visualisaiton, analysis and download. For instance, it is possible to search for "wheat drought" then to refine the search to the "Triticum aestivum" taxon and yield compononent traits such as "Thousand Grain Wheight". The indexed data types are very broad and include genomic features, such as genes or transposable elements, selected bibliography, QTL, markers, genetic variation studies, phenomic studies and plant genetic resources ie germplasms. This inclusiveness is achieved thanks to a two stage indexation data model. The most generic one provides basic search functionalities and relies on five fields : name, link back URL, data type, species and exhaustive description. The filtering is directly tied to some of those fields. Therefore, to provide more advanced filtering, FAIDARE is also providing a second stage indexation mechanism by taking advantage of BrAPi endpoints to get more detailled metadata on genotyping and phenotyping studies as well as germplasms. In parralel, FAIDARE provides a previsualisaiton of germplasm and studies using dedicated cards.
The indexation mechanism relies on a dedicated public software (https://github.com/elixir-europe/plant-brapi-etl-faidare) that allows data resources manager to request the indexation of there database using pull requests. It is able to extract data from any BrAPI 1.3 and 1.2 endpoint and development of BrAPI 2.x indexation will be intitated in 2025. Since not all databases are willing to implement BrAPI endpoints, we also provide the possibility to generate metadata as BrAPI json files, hence using the standard as a file exchange format.
FAIDARE has been adopted by several communities and in particular in the ELIXIR and EMPHASIS european infrastructures. It is also used by the WheatIS of the Wheatinitiative. Several databases are added each year to the FAIDARE global federation, allowing to increase both the portal and the BrAPI adoption.



#### Phenospex - HortControl

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
HortControl, developed by Phenospex, is a data repository. HortControl has a BrAPI implementation to be used to automate workflows and analytics software. 

#### GLIS

The Global Information System (GLIS) on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) is a web-based global entry point for users and third-party systems to access information and knowledge on scientific, technical and environmental matters to strengthen PGRFA conservation, management and utilization activities. The system and its portal also enable recipients of PGRFA to make available all non-confidential information on germplasm according to the provisions of the Treaty and facilitates access to the results of their research and development. 
 
Thanks to the adoption of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to PGRFA ex situ and in situ based on the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors (MCPD), the Portal provides access to 1,7 million PGRFA in collections conserved worldwide. Of these, over 1.5 million are accessible for research, training and plant breeding in the food and agriculture domain.
 
The Scientific Advisory Committee of the International Treaty and the Governing Body have repeatedly welcomed efforts on interoperability among germplasm information systems. In this context, the GLIS Portal adopted the Breeding API (BrAPI v1) in 2022. Integrating the BrAPI among the GLIS content negotiators facilitates queries and the exchange of content for data management in plant breeding. The Portal also offers other protocols (XML, DarwinCore, JSON and JSON-LD) to increase data and metadata connectivity.In the near future, depending on the availability of resources, upgrading to BrAPI v2 is planned.

#### FLORILÈGE (Gateway to French Plant Genetic Resources)

Designed primarily for the general public, Florilège provides access to all French plant biological resources centers. Its interface allows individuals to browse available plant accessions and gives them the possibility to order them. The listed accessions originate from 19 resources centers and concern around fifty plant species.

Florilège retrieves accession information from different BrAPI-compliant systems such as OLGA, an internal accessions management system, or FAIDARE. Leveraging the BrAPI implementation of these systems ensures standardized data retrieval from multiple sources, making the integration of new data sources that implement BrAPI an effortless process. The implementation of BrAPI is a prerequisite for the integration of any new database in Florilège.

Florilège is developed in Drupal 10, and uses xnttbrapi module (to easily connect to BrAPI compliant external databases).
