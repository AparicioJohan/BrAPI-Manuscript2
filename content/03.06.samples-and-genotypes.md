#### DArT Sample Submission

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
The DArT genotyping lab is heavily used world wide when it comes to plant genotyping. Developers at DArT have worked with the BrAPI community to establish a standard API for sending sample metadata to the lab before genotyping. This eliminates much of the human error involved with sending samples to en external lab. 

#### MGIS

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
MGIS has germplasm and genotype data stored for many musa accessions. Through BrAPI, users are able to access this data directly from MusaBase, for use in specific experiments. 

#### GIGWA

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
GIGWA is an efficient storage system for genotype variant data. GIGWA uses BrAPI to query specific variant data out of the database. This allows for more efficient data transfer and analysis. Instead of transferring whole massive files, specific pieces, samples, markers, or chunks of data can be retrieved. 

#### PHG

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
The Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) project allows the review and analysis of genotype data in a different format. The data stored in the PHG system is accessible through BrAPI, making it compatible with older existing analysis pipelines.
